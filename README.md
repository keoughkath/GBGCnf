# GBGCnf
Nextflow pipeline for selection analysis accounting for GC-biased gene conversion (GBGC). This is basically a Nextflow wrapper around the scripts from [Kostka et al. 2012, MBE](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-abstract/29/3/1047/1008844&hl=en&sa=T&oi=gsb&ct=res&cd=0&d=17716444972052306756&ei=CnBSYI7WI4-UyQTviLWwCg&scisig=AAGBfm1HDyBbAQnZIwNoY4hkHtyTi1NGWg).

This project is under construction and has many bugs. If you find one, please submit an issue. Thanks!
